Task: Migrate Configuration Reference
Summary: Moved detailed configuration tables and complex examples from README.md to docs/configuration.md. Simplified the configuration section in README and added a link to the new guide.
Files: README.md, docs/configuration.md
Why: To keep the README focused on introduction and quick start while maintaining comprehensive reference material.
