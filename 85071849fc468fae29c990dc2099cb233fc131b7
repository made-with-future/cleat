Task: Update internal/ui to support error notifications\nSummary: Added fatalError field to UI model and implemented a red status bar at the bottom of the TUI to display critical errors. Updated handleEnterKey to capture and display errors during command/task resolution.\nFiles: internal/ui/model.go, internal/ui/rendering.go, internal/ui/events.go\nWhy: To ensure that 'deal-breaker' errors are surfaced to the user in a clear and actionable way within the TUI.
