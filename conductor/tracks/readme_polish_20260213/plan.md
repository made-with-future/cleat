# Implementation Plan: README Refinement and Branding Polish

This plan outlines the steps to improve the project's branding and primary documentation for better clarity and onboarding.

## Phase 1: Branding and High-Level Content
Update the byline and refine the problem statement.

- [ ] Task: Update project byline
    - [ ] Replace "divergent" with "diverse" in the `README.md` and any other relevant files (e.g., `internal/cmd/root.go`).
- [ ] Task: Refine "The Problem" section
    - [ ] Rewrite the "Operational Drift" section to be more compelling and relatable.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Branding and High-Level Content' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Feature Illustration
Add examples to each key feature to "show, don't tell".

- [ ] Task: Enhance "Features" section
    - [ ] Add a code block example for "Standardized Commands" (e.g., `cleat build`).
    - [ ] Add a code block example for "Workflows" (e.g., a snippet of `cleat.yaml`).
    - [ ] Add a code block example for "Auto-Detection" (e.g., what Cleat finds).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Feature Illustration' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Onboarding Optimization
Implement the Quick Start checklist and streamline the flow.

- [ ] Task: Implement "Quick Start" checklist
    - [ ] Add a concise checklist to the top of the "Installation" or "Getting Started" section.
- [ ] Task: Polish the onboarding flow
    - [ ] Ensure the transition from installation to usage is extremely clear.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Onboarding Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Finalization and Submission
Clean up history and submit the changes.

- [ ] Task: Squash commits and push
    - [ ] Squash all track commits into a single clean commit.
    - [ ] Push the feature branch to GitHub and create a PR.
