  "description": "Test coverage is thin for the special workflow command. The single test (TestRunWorkflowCmd_ExternalFile) only verifies that MockExecutor.Run was called. It doesn't assert: Which command was actually run, That multi-step workflows execute in order, That input prompting works correctly, That unknown workflow names produce proper errors, That recursive/circular workflows are handled, That the workflow file merge precedence (cleat.yaml -> project file -> user file) works correctly."
